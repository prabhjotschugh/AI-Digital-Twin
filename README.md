# <h1>AI Digital Twin 🎥🤖</h1>
Welcome to the AI Digital Twin project repository! This project creates a digital twin of a public figure using AI models to generate responses, convert textual responses into audio, and sync the audio with video for a seamless experience.

## Project Overview
#### 1. Generate AI Response 🧠
The first step is to use a pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate responses to questions as if they were answered by a specific public figure (e.g., Joe Biden). The model is fine-tuned to understand the context and nuances of how the public figure typically responds, providing realistic and coherent answers.

#### 2. Convert Text to Audio 🎙️
Once the AI generates a textual response, the next step is to convert this text into audio. This involves using text-to-speech (TTS) technology, which can be customized to mimic the voice of the public figure. The goal is to produce natural-sounding speech that aligns with the personality and speaking style of the figure.

#### 3. Integrate Audio with Video 🎞️
The final step is to merge the generated audio with a sample video of the public figure. This involves lip-sync technology to ensure the audio matches the mouth movements in the video, creating a seamless and realistic digital twin. The result is a video where the public figure appears to be naturally answering the questions asked, providing an immersive and interactive experience.

## Usage 
- Ask Questions: Input questions to the model and generate responses.
- Generate Audio: Convert the generated text to audio.
- Create Videos: Integrate the audio with a video to produce a realistic digital twin.
